# Xray-Lab-Imaging-Simulation
The purpose of this repository is to provide a simulation tool for X-ray laboratory Computed Tomography (CT) Imaging. Given a digital object (2D or 3D), the tool can perform simulated scans using relevant X-ray Absorption Imaging parameters including:
- Material elements
- Acceleration voltage
- Object positioning in the scanner
- Filters applied to the radiation from the target.

This tool highlights the artifacts that arise due to poly-chromatic beams. This tool is made in part to enhance the course "47209: 3D Imaging, Analysis and Modelling" at the Technical University of Denmark, DTU Energy.
